# classify_ASL_letter
## Import ASL image data, classify letters (A-Z). 
### Offshoot of a DataCamp project to use alternative larger dataset (downloaded from Kaggle) and include entire alphabet. While the original DC project model classifies letters within A, B, or C to 95% accuracy, this extended model classifies letters within A-Z to 89% accuracy. 
##### Data downloaded from Kaggle, stored in Github. Notebook written in Colab.
